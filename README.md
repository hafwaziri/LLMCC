# LLMCC
Repo for my thesis on building compiler utilizing LLMs for C and C++.

Currently only early-stage prototypes and/or barebones skeletons of the scripts and project structure are available.
Most of the scripts/source code, datasets, methods and ideas for the thesis are proofs of concept initially. Most of these are subject to change as the thesis progresses.
